# Hi, I'm Chris! ðŸ‘‹



I am a recent computing graduate from British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT)'s accelerated Computer Information Technology (CIT) Program with a passion for web development. When I was younger, I would Google how to create my own website. I didn't have the knowledge to pursue it until many years later in my very first web development course. From there I fell in love with coding, solving problems and visually seeing the changes I am implementing.

During my time at BCIT, I have had the chance to work on many group projects including collaborating with Immunize.io and BCIT's School of Nursing. In my free time, I also like to incorporate my own interests and hobbies into my personal projects. Aside from web development, the CIT program taught me database management, web security and building CI/CD pipelines.

I am excited to step into the industry and continue my learning with front-end, back-end, and full-stack positions!
